# Agent Coordination Plan - Claude Code Systems Merge

## Overview
This document defines the specific coordination protocols, communication patterns, and responsibility matrix for executing the Claude Code agent systems merge. Each agent has clearly defined roles, reporting requirements, and coordination touchpoints.

## Executive Control Structure

### Control Agent Authority
The Control Agent maintains ultimate authority throughout the merge process with these enhanced responsibilities:

**Pre-Merge Authorization**:
- Must approve merge initiation with >99% confidence
- Validates all phase plans before execution
- Ensures rollback procedures are ready

**During Merge Oversight**:
- Monitors progress every 15 minutes during active phases
- Validates quality gates at end of each phase
- Can halt merge immediately if confidence drops below 99%

**Post-Merge Validation**:
- Final system functionality approval
- Sign-off on successful integration
- Authorization for production use

## Inter-Agent Communication Standards

### Message Format Requirements
All agents must use this standardized format for merge communications:

```yaml
Standard Message Template:
  agent_id: "[sending-agent-name]"
  target_agent: "[receiving-agent-name]"
  message_type: "[status_update/request/approval/notification]"
  phase: "[current-phase-number]"
  task: "[specific-task-reference]"
  content: "[detailed-message-content]"
  confidence_level: "[percentage-if-applicable]"
  timestamp: "[ISO-format-timestamp]"
  requires_response: "[true/false]"
```

### Escalation Procedures

#### Level 1: Task-Level Issues
**Trigger**: Individual task problems, delays, or minor conflicts
**Protocol**:
1. Agent reports issue to immediate supervisor (per coordination matrix)
2. Supervisor attempts resolution within 5 minutes
3. If unresolved, escalate to Level 2

#### Level 2: Phase-Level Issues
**Trigger**: Multiple task issues, phase delays, or coordination conflicts
**Protocol**:
1. Phase coordinator reports to Control Agent
2. Control Agent assesses impact and confidence level
3. If confidence <99%, escalate to Level 3

#### Level 3: Merge-Critical Issues
**Trigger**: System-wide problems, confidence <95%, or critical failures
**Protocol**:
1. Control Agent initiates immediate pause
2. All agents halt current activities
3. Emergency assessment and rollback consideration
4. Requires explicit approval to continue

### Quality Gate Checkpoints

#### Phase Completion Gates
Each phase requires explicit Control Agent approval based on:

```yaml
Phase 1 Gate:
  criteria:
    - Complete system backup verified
    - Directory structure unified
    - CLAUDE.md enhancement planned
    - Zero breaking changes
