- Run `shellcheck install.sh setup-firecrawl-mcp.sh uninstall.sh` before committing script changes.
- Run a Markdown linter on changed `.md` files.
- Minimal smoke tests: verify `/agents` lists all 12 agents; confirm observation updates when ledgers change; test Firecrawl prompt after MCP setup.
- If a CI exists later, gate on shellcheck + markdownlint.
