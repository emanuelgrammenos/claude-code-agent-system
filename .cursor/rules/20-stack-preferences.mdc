- Agents: keep YAML frontmatter valid; ensure roles and tools reflect @CLAUDE.md.
- Ledgers: maintain explicit task states and transitions; avoid retroactive edits except for corrections.
- Observation: adhere to @observation/agent-hooks.md capture contracts.
- MCP: configure Firecrawl via `./setup-firecrawl-mcp.sh`; never commit real keys.
