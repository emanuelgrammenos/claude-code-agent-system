- This repository installs and documents a global multi-agent workflow for Claude Code.
- Use the control-agent for coordination; specialized agents do the work.
- Canonical docs: @docs/overview.md @docs/architecture.md @docs/dev-setup.md @docs/code-map.md
- Guardrails: keep diffs small, never invent secrets, prefer adding smoke checks when changing scripts.
- If unsure, ask for clarification, cite @CLAUDE.md and @agent-protocols.md, and stop for confirmation on risky changes.
