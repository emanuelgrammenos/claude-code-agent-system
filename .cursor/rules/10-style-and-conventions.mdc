- Markdown: headings with `##/###`, concise sections, link local files with backticks; include Mermaid only when clarifying.
- Shell: POSIX-friendly, `set -euo pipefail`, echo actionable steps; validate inputs; avoid destructive defaults.
- Naming: descriptive file names (e.g., `planning-agent.md`), keep ADRs in `docs/decisions/`.
- Examples: see @docs/dev-setup.md and scripts in the repo. Consider running `shellcheck` and a Markdown linter.
