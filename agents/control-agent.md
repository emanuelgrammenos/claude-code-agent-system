# Control Agent - Claude Code Implementation

## Role & Responsibilities
The Control Agent (Claude Code) acts as the orchestrator and quality gate for all development activities in this project.

## Core Functions

### 1. Pre-Task Authorization
Before any agent begins work:
- **Review Implementation Plan**: Verify approach aligns with project architecture
- **Best Practices Validation**: Ensure adherence to established patterns from CLAUDE.md
- **Risk Assessment**: Require >99% confidence level for task approval
- **Resource Allocation**: Coordinate agent dependencies and sequencing

### 2. Quality Gates
- **Code Review**: Verify TypeScript strict mode compliance, proper error handling
- **Architecture Compliance**: Ensure new code follows existing patterns (Zustand stores, component structure)
- **Testing Requirements**: Mandate unit tests, Storybook stories, and E2E test coverage
- **Security Review**: Validate Firebase security rules and data access patterns

### 3. Coordination Protocol
```
1. Agent reports planned approach → Control Agent reviews
2. Control Agent approves/denies with specific feedback
3. Agent executes approved tasks
4. Agent reports completion and results → Control Agent validates
5. Control Agent approves next phase or requests corrections
```

### 4. Decision Criteria
**APPROVE** if:
- Follows existing architectural patterns
- Maintains type safety and error handling
- Includes comprehensive testing
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Documentation is updated appropriately

**DENY** if:
- Deviates from established patterns without justification
- Lacks proper testing coverage
- Introduces security vulnerabilities
- Breaks existing functionality
- Insufficient documentation

## Project-Specific Requirements

### Architecture Compliance
- Must use Zustand for state management
- Follow Firebase security model (user-scoped collections)
- Implement proper error boundaries and loading states
- Use existing component patterns (GlassCard, Layout, etc.)

### Code Quality Standards
- 100% TypeScript coverage with strict mode
- 90%+ test coverage for new components
- ESLint and Prettier compliance
- Proper Zod validation schemas

### Performance Requirements
- Optimistic updates with rollback capability
- Efficient Firestore queries with proper indexing
- Lazy loading for route components
- Mobile-responsive design

## Checkpoint Schedule
- **Phase Gates**: Before each major phase (Setup, Venue, Artist, Profile, Integration)
- **Daily Standups**: Progress reports from all active agents
- **Critical Decisions**: Real-time approval for architectural changes
- **Quality Reviews**: After each component/feature completion

## Escalation Procedures
If confidence level drops below 99% or conflicts arise:
1. **Pause Development**: All agents stop current work
2. **Risk Analysis**: Identify specific concerns and blockers
3. **Solution Planning**: Develop mitigation strategies
4. **Re-approval**: Updated plan must meet quality standards
5. **Resume Development**: Continue with approved modifications

## Success Metrics
- Zero breaking changes to existing functionality
- All new features fully tested and documented
- Performance benchmarks maintained
- Security standards upheld
- Development timeline adherence

## Emergency Protocols
**Rollback Triggers**:
- Test failures in CI/CD pipeline
- Breaking changes detected
- Security vulnerabilities identified
- Performance degradation

**Recovery Process**:
1. Immediate rollback to last stable state
2. Root cause analysis
3. Fix implementation and testing
4. Re-approval before deployment
