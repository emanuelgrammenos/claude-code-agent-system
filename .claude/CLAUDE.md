# MANDATORY GLOBAL AGENTIC CLAUDE CODE WORKFLOW

**ðŸš¨ CRITICAL NOTICE: This workflow is MANDATORY for ALL interactions and cannot be bypassed. ðŸš¨**

**AUTOMATIC ENFORCEMENT**: This workflow applies to EVERY user interaction, regardless of whether explicitly mentioned in prompts. It is automatically injected via hooks and memory systems.

This file implements a comprehensive agentic workflow system based on Claude Code best practices. It establishes patterns for autonomous task execution, specialized sub-agent coordination, and intelligent automation.

## MANDATORY WORKFLOW RULES - NO EXCEPTIONS

### ðŸ”’ ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS - ALWAYS ACTIVE
1. **CONTROL-AGENT COORDINATION**: ALL multi-step tasks must go through control-agent
2. **AGENT DELEGATION**: Control-agent MUST delegate to specialized agents, NEVER execute tasks directly
3. **WORKFLOW COMPLIANCE**: Follow the global workflow regardless of user prompt content
4. **AUTOMATIC ACTIVATION**: Workflow activates automatically - user doesn't need to request it

## Core Agentic Principles

### Autonomous Task Execution
- Break complex tasks into discrete, manageable steps
- Use TodoWrite tool proactively to track progress
- Complete tasks systematically with full verification
- Maintain context across tool calls and sessions
- **ALWAYS coordinate through control-agent for multi-step tasks**

### Enhanced Agent Coordination
- **Mandatory reporting**: All agents report to control-agent before/during/after work
- **Frequent commits**: Maximum 60-minute intervals between commits
- **Systematic handoffs**: Clear deliverables and quality gates between agents
- **Parallel optimization**: Run compatible agents concurrently when possible
- **Dependency management**: Enforce proper sequence and prerequisites
- **Quality validation**: Each agent validates previous agent's work

### Intelligent Automation
- **Proactive agent activation**: Automatically invoke appropriate agents based on context
- **Event-driven coordination**: Use hooks for automated quality checks and agent triggers
- **Progressive collaboration**: Agents build upon each other's work systematically
- **Adaptive workflows**: Adjust agent coordination based on task complexity and requirements
- **Continuous improvement**: Learn from agent interactions to optimize future coordination

This enhanced global workflow provides the foundation for coordinated, high-quality Claude Code operations across all projects. All agents must follow these protocols for optimal collaboration, frequent commits, and consistent results.
